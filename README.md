# Treasury Robo Advisor

## There are three notebooks 
 - eda.ipynb is the exploratory model
 - cashflows_test.ipynb is a prototype which incorporates cash flows but is still being developed.  
 - treasury_robo_advisor_test.ipynb is the most current model.  Run this notebook for latest results.

## Run pip install -r requirements.txt, if you run into issues I recommend creating a new virtual envonrment and installing dependencies there.
